Causal Taxonomy of AI Risks v0.1
The Causal Taxonomy of AI Risks,
adapted from Yampolskiy (2016),
classifies risks by its causal factors (1)
entity (human, AI), (2) intentionality
(intentional, unintentional), and (3) timing
(pre-deployment, post-deployment).

Domain Taxonomy of AI Risks v0.1
The Domain Taxonomy of AI Risks
adapted from Weidinger (2022) classifies
risks into 7 AI risk domains: (1)
Discrimination & Toxicity, (2) Privacy &
Security, (3) Misinformation, (4) Malicious
Actors & Misuse, (5) Human-Computer
Interaction, (6) Socioeconomic &
Environmental, and (7) AI System Safety,
Failures, & Limitations. These are further
divided into 24 subdomains.
