Title: Generative AI and ChatGPT: Applications, Challenges, and AI-Human Collaboration\nDomain: 6. Socioeconomic and Environmental\nSub-domain: 6.3 > Economic and cultural devaluation of human effort\nRisk Category: Technology concerns\nRisk Subcategory: Authenticity\nDescription: "As the advancement of generative AI increases, it becomes harder to determine the authenticity of a piece of work. Photos that seem to capture events or people in the real world may be synthesized by DeepFake AI. The power of generative AI could lead to large-scale manipulations of images and videos, worsening the problem of the spread of fake information or news on social media platforms (Gragnaniello et al., 2022). In the field of arts, an artistic portrait or music could be the direct output of an algorithm. Critics have raised the issue that AI-generated artwork lacks authenticity since algorithms tend to generate generic and repetitive results (McCormack et al., 2019)."\nEntity: 2 - AI\nIntent: 3 - Other\nTiming: 2 - Post-deployment
