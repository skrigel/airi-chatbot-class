Unnamed: 9: AI harms animals due to mistake or misadventure in the way the AI operates in practice 
Unnamed: 11: "Future harm could result from AI operating with relatively high intelligence and autonomy in achieving its goals (Russell, 2019). Stuart Russell half humorously suggests that a robot chef which runs out of meat might decide to cook the cat (Havens, 2015). But something vaguely similar might occur and is worth pre-empting. For example, an advanced robot on a fruit and vegetable farm may decide to destroy small animals that enter the farm by ‘reasoning’ that they threaten the valuable produce."
